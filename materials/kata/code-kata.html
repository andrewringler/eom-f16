		<h2>Processing</h2>
		<h3>Coordinate System and Drawing</h3>
		<p>
			Concepts: coordinate system, drawing, setup(), rect(), mental math
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>draw a square in the center of the canvas</li>
			<li>draw a square centered on top of your previous square</li>
			<li>draw a square “inside” another square</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Interaction</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>draw a single line, that follows the mouse pointer around the screen</li>
			<li>draw two parallel lines, that follows the mouse pointer around the screen</li>
			<li>draw thirty parallel lines, that follow the mouse pointer around the screen (use a <a href="https://processing.org/reference/for.html">for-loop</a>)</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Modularity (Functions, Classes, Tabs)</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>take assignment #1, group and pull out elements, turn them into functions. they don't need to have function arguments.</li>
			<li></li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Code Reading</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Choose a library that interests you from <a href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/">processing.org/reference/libraries</a>. Usually you can install from the Processing menu: 
<pre><code>Sketch | Import Library… | Add Library…</code></pre>
				The library should then be available in <code>Documents/Processing/libraries</code>. Find the examples folder and run them. Choose an example you like. Read through the code, figure out how it works. Read the library documentation. Change the example, see the affects your changes have. Save various iterations. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		
		<h2>Code (Max or Processing)</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Make a list of five features you would like to try with your code. In teams, try to do one thing, for each project, pair-programming, switching back and forth. Rotate, pick a different project and feature, repeat.
