	In class exercises (before lecture) pairs
	concepts to review: variables, math, random, animation, looping

	- draw a line on the screen between two random points
		- every second draw another random line, without erasing the first one
	- draw 2 parallel lines at a random location
		- every second draw another pair of parallel lines at a new random location
			without erasing the previous pairs
		- how about 50 parallel lines?
		
		
		
		
		
		
		Take assignment 1, try to simplify the code,
make it easier to make changes / explore by:
* add variables
* math
* and loops

Then make changes to your variables / save various versions	






After lecture:
- Draw a circle, triangle and square under the current mouse position
- Draw two overlapping circles, draw them more overlapped when the mouse
	is moving fast, and less overlapped when the mouse is moving slow
	
	
	
	
	
	In class exercises: (before lecture), first thing
	- created a grid with lines
	
	In class exercises: (after lecture)
	- update your grid code, use a for-loop
	
	
	
	
	[Actual]
pairs Ginnie/Raphael     Clapperton/Sajel
-draw a vertical line of circles
-draw a circle the takes up the entire canvas
-draw a circle inside another circle
-animate a circle growing



- Critique (critique, YouTube) watch video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9neybpOvjaQ thank Sayjel for posting it on her website, then actually have students present.
- Brief review of concepts to-date and resources on course website. Drawing, variables, looping, animation.
- 




- Ask students to do a 2nd revision of hw #1, 30min ?maybe





exercises should review variables, looping and animation
mix of individual and pair exercises

[Proposed]
-horizontal line of 30 circles
skills: for-loop, drawing

-grid of rectangles
skills: for-loops, drawing

-animate a circle growing then shrinking, continually
skills: animation, conditionals

draw a grid pair programming







drawing machine round-robin pairing
