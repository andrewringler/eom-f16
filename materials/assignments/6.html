  <p>Create an audio/visual musical instrument. The instrument should make sound and display visuals based on user interaction (mouse movements, key presses, etc). Make sure that interactions and their outcomes are predictable enough that a user can practice and become proficient at “playing” your instrument (i.e it cannot be too random). Your instrument can trigger snippets or sound files, or generate sound algorithmically. You may use Processing or Max.</p>
  <p>Once you have a working prototype, invite at least two people to interact with it (preferably, not fellow DMI students). Document these interactions visually, and make notes on how your users experienced your piece.</p>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>
      This assignment builds on the examples from class #7 and #8, download the zip files <a href="../examples/7.zip">week 7 (zip)</a>, or sync with the class repository for the latest examples. All deliverables are due by the date and times listed below. Source code must be synced to Github. Videos must be uploaded to Youtube or Vimeo and linked to from your student Github repository README.md file.
    </p>
    <p>
      See <a href="https://github.com/andrewringler/eom-f16-student">github.com/andrewringler/eom-f16-student</a> for an example of how to add video links to your README.md file (more information on Markdown at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown Syntax</a> and <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Mastering Markdown</a>).

    <h3>Due Friday November 4<sup>th</sup> @6:30pm</h3>
    <p>
      This part requires three Sketch revisions and three Youtube videos. This should take you no more than two hours.
    </p>
    <h4>Assignment 6.0 (~30min.)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the SonicPainterDesktop example. It is located in examples 7|processing|maxim|1_Intro_To_Audio|SonicPainterDesktop. Or just (<a href="../examples/7/processing/maxim/1_Intro_To_Audio/SonicPainterDesktop.zip">download as zip</a>).</li>
      <li>
        Run SonicPainterDesktop and see how it behaves. It changes when you press and hold your mouse button.
      </li>
      <li>
        Look at the source code. Try to figure out how various aspects are working. Change parameters, variables and anything that is a number. See how this affects the output.
      </li>
    </ol>    
    <h4>Assignment 6.1 (~15-50min.)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Make a copy of SonicPainterDesktop by clicking File|Save as…, name it a6.1. Save to your eom-f16-student folder.</li>
      <li>Change the visuals, instead of lines, how about blocks or circles. Remember <a href="3.html">assignment #3, A Drawing Tool</a>?</li>
      <li>Commit your a6.1 Sketch to Github.</li>
      <li>Videotape a user interacting with your Sketch. Upload to Youtube, create a link on your Github page.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assignment 6.2 (~15-30min.)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Starting from a6.1 make a new copy of your Sketch called a6.2</li>
      <li>Change how the Sketch sounds by replacing the .wav files in the data directory with new sound files.</li>
      <li>Commit your a6.2 Sketch to Github.</li>
      <li>Videotape a user interacting with your Sketch. Upload to Youtube, create a link on your Github page.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assignment 6.3 (~15-30min.)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Starting from a6.2 make a new copy of your Sketch called a6.3</li>
      <li>Change how the Sketch sounds by editing the values being set in setFilter, ramp and speed in the Sketch source code.</li>
      <li>Commit your a6.3 Sketch to Github.</li>
      <li>Videotape a user interacting with your Sketch. Upload to Youtube, create a link on your Github page.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Due Tuesday November 8<sup>th</sup> @6:30pm</h3>
    <h4>Assignment 6.4 (~2-5hrs)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Browse the audio examples from <a href="../examples/7.zip">week #7 (zip)</a>, Processing and Max. Run them, see how they behave. Take a look at the source code, see if you can figure out how they work.</li>
      <li>Choose an interactive audio example that you enjoy and that you somewhat understand the source code for.</li>
      <li>Make a copy of this example, call it a6.4</li>

      <li>Change how the Sketch looks, and or sounds. Spend a few hours revising your Sketch</li>
      <li>Commit your a6.4 Sketch to Github.</li>
      <li>Videotape a user interacting with your Sketch. Upload to Youtube, create a link on your Github page.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Due Friday November 11<sup>th</sup> @6:30pm</h3>
    <h4>Assignment 6.5 (~2-5hrs)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Make a copy of a6.4, call it a6.5</li>
      <li>Choose a public location where you will install your Sketch. Think about what you are trying to achieve with your Sketch.</li>
      <li>Make several revisions. Try to improve how your sketch looks and sounds. Is your instrument playable? Enjoyable? Use your location as inspiration.</li>
      <li>Commit your a6.5 Sketch to Github.</li>
      <li>Install your Sketch in your chosen public location.</li>
      <li>Videotape a user interacting with your Sketch in the public location. Upload to Youtube, create a link on your Github page.</li>
