  <p>Create an audio/visual musical instrument. The instrument should make sound and display visuals based on user interaction (mouse movements, key presses, etc). Make sure that interactions and their outcomes are predictable enough that a user can practice and become proficient at “playing” your instrument (i.e it cannot be too random). Your instrument can trigger snippets or sound files, or generate sound algorithmically. You may use Processing or Max.</p>
  <p>Once you have a working prototype, invite at least two people to interact with it (preferably, not fellow DMI students). Document these interactions visually, and make notes on how your users experienced your piece.</p>
