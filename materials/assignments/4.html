  <p>Create an aesthetic and expressive visual experience that is responsive to user interaction, time-of-day and possibly the current temperature. The sketch does not need to be a clock per-se, but it should respond in some way to the outside variable of the time of day.</p>
  <p>Consider the context of your Time Keeper. Consider a location where it should be installed. What kinds of people would visit it? How does the location influence your design, how will your Time Keeper change the location? Install your Time Keeper at this location.</p>
  <p>
    Adapted from the <i>Brian Lucid's</i>, <i>Alison Kotin's</i> and <i>Nicole Tariverdian's</i> various clock assignments.
